  <h4>My Favorite Resturaunts</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>AVEC</li>
      <li>Chiu Quon Bakery & Dim Sum</li>
      <li>Purple Pig</li>
      <li>The Signature Room at the 95th</li>
      <li>Birrieria Zaragoza</li>
    </ul>

  <p>AVEC</p>
  <p>Vegetables are treated like royalty here, particularly the charred carrots, which arrive in a tangle of ribbons and chunks with black-garlic harissa, whipped feta, Turkish Urfa chilies and dukkah-spiced crispy rice. The puffy, blistered-heel pizza is very good; I enjoyed my roasted-artichoke and smoked-tomato pie, since replaced by one with mozzarella, fermented-garlic honey and ’nduja salami.</p>

  <p>Chiu Quon Bakery & Dim Sum</p>
  <p>For a cheap à la carte lunch in Chinatown, this bright bakery has fluffy BBQ pork buns, bite-sized egg custard tarts, coconut and winter melon pastries and some dim-sum fare (shrimp dumplings, taro cake, sticky rice roll, steamed egg custard bao). It's available to go, or to scarf down by the handful at the no-frills tables in back. Cash only.</p>

  <p>Purple Pig</p>
  <p>The Pig's Magnificent Mile location, lively ambience and wide-ranging meat, cheese and veggie menu make it a crowd-pleaser. Milk-braised pork shoulder is the hamtastic specialty. Dishes are meant to be shared, and the long list of affordable vinos gets the good times rolling at communal tables both indoors and out. Alas, there are no reservations to help beat the crowds.</p>

  <p>The Signature Room at the 95th</p>
  <p>Given that diners spend most of the meal view-gaping, you’d think the kitchen atop 875 N Michigan wouldn’t trouble itself over the food, but the chef does a fine job with the fish, steak and pasta dishes. Vegetarians will find a fair number of options available. Dress for dinner is business casual; no ripped jeans or tennis shoes allowed.</p>

  <p>Birrieria Zaragoza</p>
  <p>Thick handmade tortillas, salsas made to order, cinnamon-laced coffee. You can get all of that here. Their only purpose, however, is to accompany this restaurant’s signature platters of chopped goat meat. As opposed to other birrierias, this goat doesn’t touch a consommé until it’s plated, when some of the tomato-based broth is spooned over it. At that point, a good dousing of the restaurant’s intricate hot sauce, and maybe a squeeze of lime and some onions, is all you need for one of the city’s best goat tacos.</p>
